Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of program execution based on certain conditions. There are three main types of conditional statements in Java:

1. if statement: This is the most basic type of conditional statement in Java. It is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The syntax is as follows:

``` 
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```
2. if-else statement: This type of conditional statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. The syntax is as follows:

```
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```
3. switch statement: This type of conditional statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable. The syntax is as follows:

```
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // code to execute if variable equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to execute if variable equals value2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if variable does not equal any of the values above
        break;
}
```

In summary, conditional statements in Java allow developers to control the flow of program execution based on certain conditions, using if, if-else, and switch statements.
