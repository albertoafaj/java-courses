Repetition loops in Java, also known as iteration statements or loops, are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are three main types of repetition loops in Java:

1. while loop: This type of repetition loop is used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. The syntax is as follows:

```
while (condition) {
    // code to repeat while condition is true
}
```

2. do-while loop: This type of repetition loop is similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition. The syntax is as follows:

```
do {
    // code to repeat
} while (condition);
```
3. for loop: This type of repetition loop is used to repeat a block of code for a specific number of times, based on a counter variable. The syntax is as follows:

```
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to repeat
}
```
In the for loop, the initialization statement initializes the counter variable, the condition statement checks whether the counter variable has reached a certain value, and the update statement updates the counter variable at the end of each iteration.

In summary, repetition loops in Java allow developers to repeat a block of code multiple times using the while, do-while, and for loops, based on certain conditions or a specific number of iterations.
