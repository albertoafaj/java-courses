# Persistent Storage of Data

DAO stands for Data Access Object, which is a design pattern used in Java to separate the data access logic from the rest of the application. The DAO pattern provides an abstraction layer between the application and the database, making it easier to maintain and modify the application over time.

In the DAO pattern, a DAO class is responsible for providing an interface to interact with the database. It provides methods for performing common database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data. The DAO class can hide the details of the database implementation, allowing the application to be database-independent.

Here's an example of a DAO class in Java:

```
public class UserDao {

    private Connection conn;

    public UserDao(Connection conn) {
        this.conn = conn;
    }

    public void saveUser(User user) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
        try {
            String sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)";
            pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            pstmt.setString(1, user.getName());
            pstmt.setString(2, user.getEmail());
            pstmt.executeUpdate();
        } finally {
            if (pstmt != null) {
                pstmt.close();
            }
        }
    }

    public User getUserById(int id) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;
        try {
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
            pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            pstmt.setInt(1, id);
            rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
            if (rs.next()) {
                String name = rs.getString("name");
                String email = rs.getString("email");
                return new User(id, name, email);
            } else {
                return null;
            }
        } finally {
            if (rs != null) {
                rs.close();
            }
            if (pstmt != null) {
                pstmt.close();
            }
        }
    }
    
    // other methods for updating and deleting users
}
```
In this example, the UserDao class provides methods for inserting a user into the database (saveUser()) and retrieving a user by ID from the database (getUserById()). The class takes a Connection object in its constructor, which is used to perform the database operations.

By using a DAO class like this, the rest of the application can interact with the database through a simple interface, without needing to know the details of how the database is implemented or how the data access logic works.
