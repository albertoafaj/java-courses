# Enumerator

In Java, an enum (short for "enumerator") is a special type of class that represents a fixed set of constants. Enumerations are often used to represent things like days of the week, months of the year, or colors.

Here are some key points about enums in Java:

Enum constants are implicitly public, static, and final.

Enum types can have constructors, methods, and fields just like regular classes.

Enum types can implement interfaces and extend classes.

Enum constants are typically named using all capital letters.

Enum constants can have values associated with them, which can be accessed using a getter method.

Enums can be used in switch statements.

Here's an example of an enum in Java:

```
public enum Color {
    RED(255, 0, 0),
    GREEN(0, 255, 0),
    BLUE(0, 0, 255);

    private final int red;
    private final int green;
    private final int blue;

    Color(int red, int green, int blue) {
        this.red = red;
        this.green = green;
        this.blue = blue;
    }

    public int getRed() {
        return red;
    }

    public int getGreen() {
        return green;
    }

    public int getBlue() {
        return blue;
    }
}
```

In this example, we've defined an enum called Color that has three constants: RED, GREEN, and BLUE. Each constant has three associated values for the red, green, and blue components of the color.

We've also defined a constructor for the Color enum that takes three parameters for the red, green, and blue values, and getter methods for each of these values.

We can use this enum to represent colors in our code, like this:

```
Color myColor = Color.RED;
System.out.println("My color is " + myColor + " with RGB values " + myColor.getRed() + ", " + myColor.getGreen() + ", " + myColor.getBlue());
This will output "My color is RED with RGB values 255, 0, 0" to the console.
